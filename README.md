# Overview

This is a simple trading card game card pack opening simulator written in Python and utilizing the Arcade extension. I started this project because I am an aspiring game developer and I want to learn how to code games in other manners (I only am familiar with making games in  Godot), and also I have a love for trading card games. When the game runs, a window opens, and you have buttons that will display random cards from a library of cards when clicked.

# Development Environment

This was developed in Visual Studio Code, and was written in Python. It uses a downloaded extension called Arcade, which has a lot of prebuilt functions such as opening windows and drawing simple images and sprites. I also used the library random for generating random cards and the library os for troubleshooting.

# Future Work

* I need to fix whatever's wrong with the second pack button. I need to make it so it functions just like the first pack button.
* I want to add more buttons for packs for other trading card games, like One Piece and Lorcana, to make everything more interesting.
* I want to make it an actual game- that is, the ability to save what cards have been pulled, and a system that makes an actual requirement for opening card packs, not just clicking on buttons with zero cost, but maybe a time based requirement, or you are permitted to open more packs at the cost of trading away singular cards.
